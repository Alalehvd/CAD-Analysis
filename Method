Materials and Methods
Data Acquisition
Raw Affymetrix Canine 2.0 microarray data (*.CEL.gz files) corresponding to healthy skin, non-lesional atopic dermatitis (NLAD), and lesional atopic dermatitis (ALAD) samples were obtained from the GEO Database. Each sample was associated with a GSM accession number and group label based on the original study metadata.

Preprocessing and Normalization
All raw microarray data were processed in R (version 4.x) using the Bioconductor package affy. CEL files were imported with ReadAffy(), and probe-level intensities were background-corrected, normalized, and log2-transformed using the Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) algorithm. The resulting probe-level expression matrix was saved as expression_rma_probes.csv. Probe set identifiers were annotated to gene symbols using the canine2.db package.

Metadata Curation
Sample metadata were constructed from file names, extracting GSM accession numbers and assigning group labels ("Healthy", "NLAD", "ALAD") according to tissue type annotations. The final metadata table (samples_metadata.csv) included GSM IDs, original file names, and assigned group.

Differential Gene Expression Analysis
Normalized expression values were imported into limma for differential expression analysis. A design matrix was constructed with group as a factor (Healthy, NLAD, ALAD), and contrasts were defined for:

ALAD vs Healthy

NLAD vs Healthy

Linear models were fitted with lmFit(), empirical Bayes moderation was applied using eBayes(), and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using adjusted p-value (adj.P.Val) < 0.05 and absolute log2 fold-change (|logFC|) > 1. Multiple testing correction was performed using the Benjamini–Hochberg (FDR) method.

Functional Enrichment Analysis
Significant DEGs were mapped to Entrez Gene IDs using org.Cf.eg.db. Functional enrichment for Gene Ontology Biological Process (GO BP) terms was performed using clusterProfiler::enrichGO(), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment was performed with enrichKEGG() (organism code cfa). Enrichment results were filtered at a q-value cutoff of 0.05. Bar plots of the top enriched terms were generated with enrichplot and ggplot2.

Visualization
Heatmaps: Top 50 DEGs per contrast were visualized using pheatmap, with hierarchical clustering applied to both genes and samples.

Volcano Plots: DEGs were visualized using ggplot2-based volcano plots, showing statistical significance (–log10 adjusted p-value) versus log2 fold-change.

Enrichment Bar Plots: Top 10 GO BP terms and KEGG pathways were plotted for each contrast.
